The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it may lead to unexpected results if not used properly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected if the parent container doesn't have a defined width.  Another common error is mixing units inconsistently within a single `calc()` expression.  For example, `calc(100px + 10%)` is incorrect as it tries to add pixels and percentages directly.
